If we do the floors first, and then paint the walls, we will get paint all over our new floor. \\n#Person1#: Hmm. Maybe you're right. But I can't stand all this green carpet in here. And besides, I know how to paint. I will just cover everything with drop cloth. I won't get anything on the floor. \\n#Person2#: Are you sure? \\n#Person1#: Yes, I'm sure. I've done a lot of house painting in my life. And my mother was very picky. If I got even a tiny drop of paint on her furniture, she would get furious. So I learned to be very careful.\\n#Person2#: Alright. Then maybe we can do the floor first. These wood floors under this carpet are beautiful. And me too--I can't wait to get all this old carpet out of here. But how can we get it out? Do we need to call helpers?\\n#Person1#: Absolutely not. We can remove the carpet ourselves. Carpet is held down with carpet nails. You just need to pull it hard and it comes up. \\n#Person2#: Great. Then, after we remove the carpet, we need to restain all the wood floors. Right? \\n#Person1#: Yes. But we should hire someone for that. That will probably be expensive. And it has to be done right. \\n#Person2#: And then, after the floors are done, we can start to move our furniture in. \\n#Person1#: Sure. If we can get an appointment with someone to do the floors, we should probably be able to have the furniture in here after a week or so. I can get all the carpet out this weekend. \\n#Person2#: So, after the floors are done, and after the furniture is in, we need to redo the curtains and paint all the walls and ceilings. \\n#Person1#: I'm the painter. You can be in charge of going to curtain shops to choose curtains. That will probably be pretty expensive too. Having good curtains made isn't cheap. \\n#Person3#: You mean we can't just buy curtains already made? \\n#Person2#: Absolutely not. The windows must be measured, and then the curtains need to be made professionally. So that will take a while. Maybe a month or so.\\n#Person1#: While the curtains are being made, I can start having people look at the kitchen. I can't stand that old kitchen. I won't be able to cook in there. I don't want to use that electric stove. \\n#Person2#: We will need to find an interior decorating company do redo the kitchen. I believe in Portland there are shops that specialize in kitchen renovation. I will look in the Yellow Pages. I'd like a kitchen of colors.\\n#Person1#: I agree. The colors must be soft and pleasant. You should feel comfortable when you cook our dinners. \\n#Person2#: Me? Cook our dinners? Hah! You will be cooking, dear. You will cook. \\n#Person1#: No, I don't think so. I'll be too busy having tea in our new tea room. \\n#Person2#: Well, I suppose we'll have to hire a cook then. So you won't be able to afford any \\n#Person1#: And you'll have to sell your motorcycle. And your cameras. Right? \\n#Person2#: Maybe I'll cook once or twice a week.

It is a test of people's psychological ability of endurance. Especially when descending, as if they are watching a fast forward tape and when they bounce back, they sway around. The timid people will shrink back at the sight of it. Even if they jump off, they find it hard to avoid screaming with closed eyes. No wonder people give the title'brave'to anyone who jumps off.\\n#Person2#: You see, the bungee participants take a deep breath when they stand at the starting spot and then, like diving, their heads are over heels and they jump off into the realm of the combination of heaven and earth. The wind roars at their ears and their bodies rapidly descend. They do not even have enough time to do several gymnastic movements and they are rebounded to the upper air by the cord.\\n#Person1#: Entrusting life to the care of a rope indeed requires infinite courage.\\n#Person2#: A young French fellow recalled his first bungee experience and said, ' When I fastened the cord and walked to the platform, I was extremely nervous. When I looked down, I was nervous even more. If the cord had broken, I would be knocked to'bakemeat'. However, I knew my worries were unwanted. I was afraid if I retreated others might say something about me. I had to harden my heart and impose my head downward. I only felt wind wiring at my ears. My body rapidly descended. I thought that after only seven or eight seconds I was rebounded to upper air by the cord. In fact it was 30 seconds. Maybe because of my nervousness, I only felt seven or eight seconds. When rebounding to the high altitude, I felt a sudden sense of relief. I did not feel nervous very much, but very comfortable.

How are you doing these days?\\n#Person2#: Well, I'm okay, but Brandon isn't doing so well.\\n#Person1#: What do you mean?\\n#Person2#: Well ..... I don't ... I don't know. It's kind of a strange situation. He was dating this girl ... you know Alex? He was dating her and then he ended up breaking up with her because she was using drugs, and ...\\n#Person1#: Oh, wow. Well, that was a good thing, right?\\n#Person2#: Well, yeah, that was, but now she's really angry with him, and he's having all kinds of problems with her, like last week, she punched him in the face and in the groin at school. Right in front of everyone.\\n#Person1#: Oh, man! So, what did he do about it?\\n#Person2#: Well, um ... she told him that if he said anything to a teacher, to the principal or anyone, she would get her friends to beat him up after school.\\n#Person1#: Man. This sounds really bad. I mean, you often think of men becoming aggressive toward women, but I guess it can go the other way.\\n#Person2#: Yeah, yeah. You don't really think of this, but it happens, so um ...\\n#Person1#: So, what are you going to do about it?\\n#Person2#: Well, first, Brandon said that, um, he was just going to let it go, but you know, he didn't want to cause any more problems ...\\n#Person1#: Yeah, I can see that.\\n#Person2#: Then he decided that if she was doing that to do that to him and get away with it, she'd just do it to the next guy, so he went to the principal and the school police officer and reported everything, and now they're going to press assault charges against her.\\n#Person1#: So, isn't he worried about what her friends are going to do to him?\\n#Person2#: Yeah, but he thinks that the other people in her group were just going along with her. [ Yeah. ] You know, I don't know. We'll see. They're probably frightened of what she might do to them. You know, she'll probably get suspended and have to go to court, but I don't know. He's kind of worried about some backlash.\\n#Person1#: I mean, people have to realize that you can't inflict violence on others, you know, in any type of relationship or friendship.\\n#Person2#: Yeah, that's right. Anyway, I guess ... I got to go, but I'll keep you updated on what happens.\\n#Person1#: Alright, thanks.### SUMMARY:\\n#Person2# tells #Person1# that Brandon was dating Alex but broke up with her because she used drugs.

Brandon just wanted to let it go at first but then he went to the principal and the school police officer and reported everything.
