OK, Danny, could you tell us how to produce a good piece of writing in college?\\n#Person2#: Well, one of the basic things about any writing is to remember 3 key points. Number One, say what you're going to say. So you're telling the reader what you're going to write about and maybe also your opinion in the beginning part. The second thing is say it. And here's where you provide details and facts to support what you have stated. And the third part is say it again. Conclude the main parts of your article and restate the key points that you've made and what you want your readers to understand.\\n#Person1#: But what really separates an excellent article from the average ones?\\n#Person2#: I would say it's a personal voice, because people respond to such an article much more easily. So if you want to touch the readers' feelings, your natural voice will help. That puts your writing more into the excellent type rather than 'Oh, this is a good formal article'.### SUMMARY:\\nProfessor Danny Sheffield from Arkansas Community College tells #Person1# how to produce a good piece of writing in college and a personal voice separates an excellent article from the average ones. <END>\", \"### INSTRUCTION: \\nBelow is the conversation between two persons.

Generate summary of the conversation\\n\\n#Person1#: We all know that poetry is not everyone's cup of tea. But according to Dr. James Stewart.\\n#Person2#: Hello!\\n#Person1#: Hello! If you are suffering from anxiety or depression, poetry may be the solution to your problems. Dr. Stewart, how does poetry help?\\n#Person2#: Em, OK! Look, let me give you an example. A patient came into our clinic last month. He was a middle-aged businessmen, and he was feeling, well, like most middle-aged businessmen, really stressed and with his life out of control. He talked to me about it, and, well, I was convinced that medication just wouldn't help him. Then I read him a poem called Leisure by WHDavis. Do you know the one? It begins, er...\\n#Person1#: I do, yes.\\n#Person2#: What is this life, er, so full of. It is so or if...\\n#Person1#: I think it's if.\\n#Person2#: If full of care, that's it, yes. We have no time to stand and stare. Well, you know the one. The next time he came to see me, he told me that, well, it was a sort of turning point for him. The poem made him think about the quality of his life and the need to find a balance between his work and his social life. Er, you see, because the idea was expressed poetically, he felt that he could identify with it, and actually feel the message in a way that he wouldn't if he simply discussed it with me. And we just had the usual kind of conversation about it.\\n#Person1#: Yes, I see.\\n#Person2#: You see, reading poetry to patients seems to make them calmer. Encouraging them to write it has an even more dramatic effect, actually. Era, there.., there are something about the process of expressing confused thoughts and feelings and emotions in writing that actually helps people or suffering from stress and anxiety. This happens especially if the words are written in a poetical way with a sense of rhythm rather than in prose, you see. Er, now, for a long time, we've been asking patients to write diaries to put their feelings into words. But it turns out that writing poetry seems to work much better for many patients.\\n#Person1#: Right, and have you found that other doctors and therapists have made the same discoveries?\\n#Person2#: Yes, many of my colleagues have successfully used poetry with patients suffering from anxiety or depression or even eating disorders. I mean their patients said that, that reading poetry made them feel less stressed. You know, almost as many said that writing it has the same effect. You see, some said that writing poetry reduced the pain they felt when a friend or a close relation had died extraordinarily!\\n#Person1#: Yes, it certainly is!\\n#Person2#: Era. Others thought that it enabled them to reduce or stop taking antidepressants or tranquillizers. And writing poetry helps them to provide a sort of outlet for their emotions.\\n#Person1#: Em, that's fascinating! Can you give any explanation as to why poetry might be calming in this way?\\n#Person2#: Well, it's only a guess. But I say that the calming effect of poetry is related to an interplay between the left and right hemispheres of the brain, the.., you probably know the left half is the one which analyzes and responds to language while the right one visualizes images and responds to rhythm. Now, I believe that poetry may activate the system at the base of the brain where thoughts meet emotions, you see.\\n#Person1#: Do you think that people need a doctor to prescribe particular poems for particular conditions?\\n#Person2#: No, no, no. I think poetry can help everyone to feel calm and less stressed. People who read poetry tend not to be anxious and stressed, probably because they are in touch with their emotions. I mean they certainly don't need a doctor to tell them which poems to read.\\n#Person1#: Thank you very much, Dr. Stewart.\\n#Person2#: You are welcome.### SUMMARY:\\nDr. Stewart thinks poetry may be the solution to people's problems when they suffer from anxiety or depression. He gives an example that he read a patient a poem called Leisure by WHDavis, and the patient realizes finding a balance between work and social life.

A lot of Americans, including many scientists, believe in religion.\\n#Person2#: But I'm really surprised.

It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England.\\n#Person2#: Why was it founded by the Puritans? Where were the atheistic educators?\\n#Person1#: Because most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans.\\n#Person2#: How come? I mean why most of them were religious people?\\n#Person1#: That's because in the 16th and 17th century, there was a series of religious reforms in England. Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries.\\n#Person2#: So, you mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England?\\n#Person1#: Yes, that's why Puritans moved to the New World, where they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans. Later on, it was these Puritans who founded Harvard College.\\n#Person2#: Why did they want to found a college?\\n#Person1#: Many Puritans had received classic style of higher education in Oxford University and Cambridge University back in England. They hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well.\\n#Person2#: Oh, I see.\\n#Person1#: Actually Harvard was first named'New College', without a formal name.\\n#Person2#: When did it begin to be called Harvard University?\\n#Person1#: In 1639, it was renamed after its major benefactor John Harvard.

I hope my visit will help to promote a friendly relationship between us.\\n#Person2#: We've been looking forward to your visit. It is a great pleasure for us to have you as our guest. It is always more convenient to discuss things face to face.\\n#Person1#: I would like to tell you that my clients are very satisfied with the last delivery of your slippers. The styles and colors are very much to the taste of our market.\\n#Person2#: We've received some similar comments from other Australian firms too.\\n#Person1#: I understand you are selling the same products to some other Australian importers. This tends to complicate my business. As you know, I am experienced in the business of slippers and enjoy a good business relationship with all the leading whole - sabers and retailers in that line. I have a mind to expand this business in the years to come. One of the reasons of my visit here is to sign a sole agency agreement with you on these items for a period of 3 years. As it is to our mutual interests and profit, I am sure you'll have no objection to it.\\n#Person2#: We appreciate your good intention and your effort in pushing the sale of our slippers. As you know, the demand for this item in your market is quite substantial.

Unless you increase the turnover we can hardly appoint you our sole agent.\\n#Person1#: I'll come to that.

Could you let me have your proposal then?\\n#Person2#: Let's put it this way. I propose a sole agency agreement for Ladies and gents plastic slippers ( excluding children's ) for a duration of 3 years ; 60, 000 pairs to be sold in the first year, 70, 000 pairs in the second year, and 80, 000 pairs in the third year, the area is to be within the continent of Australia ( excluding any neighboring island ), commission 5 %.\\n#Person1#: You certainly drive a hard bargain, Mrs. Brown.\\n#Person2#: On the contrary, Mr. London, we value your friendship more than anything else. We both understand our slippers are very popular in your market on account of their superior quality and compete - time price. And with the sole agency in your hand, there will be no competition and you can easily control the market, which would naturally result in bigger sales. I'm sure you can fulfill the agreement without much difficulty.\\n#Person1#: Well, if you put it this way, I'll have to comply. When shall we sign the contract, Mrs. Brown?\\n#Person2#: Tomorrow afternoon.\\n#Person1#: Tomorrow afternoon will be fine.### SUMMARY:\\nMrs. Brown invites Mr. London to visit their country and discuss things face to face. Mr. London wants to expand the business of slippers and wants to sign a sole agency agreement with Mrs. Brown on the slippers for a period of 3 years. Mrs. Brown thinks Mr. London's proposal is rather conservative and wants Mr. London to increase the turnover. She makes a bolder proposal and persuades Mr. London to take that.

Then there would be more space for cars to drive and we'd have fewer traffic jams.\\n#Person2#: If we built more roads, people would just fill them with cars again. I think we should discourage people from using their cars.\\n#Person1#: How would you do that?\\n#Person2#: I think we should do a few things at once. Improving public transport would encourage people to use that. If we also charge people to use their cars in the city centre, they won't use their cars as much.\\n#Person1#: I don't know. I think it's unfair to make drivers pay more money. They already pay a lot of tax-petrol tax, for example.\\n#Person2#: I think that they should pay more tax. Look at the damage they cause to the environment and people's health by discharging all those exhaust fumes.\\n#Person1#: The air would certainly be cleaner if there were fewer cars being used in the city.

How can I do that?\\n#Person2#: One good way is to do push-ups. Another way is to use weights. Make sure you grip the weights firmly. You don't want to drop them on your feet!\\n#Person1#: When I do push-ups, should I bend my elbows so that my nose touches the ground?\\n#Person2#: You don't need to bend your elbows that much.

Many people bend their bodies at the waist, which reduces the effectiveness of the exercise.\\n#Person1#: What's a good exercise for my chest muscles?\\n#Person2#: One that I recommend is that you lie on your back. You should have a weight in each hand and stretch your arms out either side of your body.\\n#Person1#: So I need plenty of space for this exercise.\\n#Person2#: Yes, you do.

In today's show, our young, but experienced, guest will introduce us to the fantastic world of bearded dragons. Welcome, Joshua. [Thank you very much.] Now, Joshua, I must admit that a bearded dragon sounds something like out of a fantasy book. What exactly is a bearded dragon?\\n#Person2#: Well, here. Why don't you hold on to Bert, [Oh ... Wow!] while I talk about him. [Okay] Bearded dragons actually originated from the deserts of Australia, and this is one of several species that survived in that climate. Today, beardies like this one are bred in captivity here in the US.\\n#Person3#: Okay. And, so what are some of the essential things to know when getting a bearded dragon? I mean, can you raise one as a family pet?\\n#Person2#: Bearded dragons make a great family pet and are very docile creatures.\\n#Person1#: Yeah, this one seems quite friendly.\\n#Person2#: You just need to know how to care for them.\\n#Person1#: Well, what are some of the things you should keep in mind?\\n#Person2#: First, you need to have the right supplies: some kind of enclosure ...\\n#Person1#: Like, like a cage or something like that.\\n#Person2#: Yeah. [Okay] A full spectrum fluorescent light bulb and a basking lamp [Okay], branches and rocks to climb on and bask on, a food or water dish, and something to line bottom of the cage.\\n#Person1#: Okay, well, let's get down to some the basics. What are the dietary needs of a bearded dragon? It sounds like a very carnivorous beast. Perhaps, uh, they eat fiery Mexican tacos or something like that.\\n#Person4#: No, bearded dragons are omnivores...\\n#Person1#: Now, Omnivores? What exactly is that?\\n#Person2#: Uh, creatures that eat insects, vegetable, and greens, the leafy parts of plants and their stems.\\n#Person1#: Okay. You mean like, for example, carrots or something like that for example. [Yeah] Okay.\\n#Person2#: Young dragons like Bert can be fed small crickets twice a day, along with some greens and shredded vegetables. [Okay.] And then as your dragon grows, you can increase the amount of greens and vegetables. [Alright.] And you can also dust the vegetables and insects with a calcium supplement to promote bone growth.\\n#Person1#: Okay, and what about water? Uh, what kind of needs do they have for that?\\n#Person2#: Well, since bearded dragons traditionally live in arid regions, they obtain most of their water naturally from what they eat, so you have to be sure to feed them plenty of vegetables that serve as good carriers of water. [Okay.] You also spray them occasionally with a water bottle or provide them with a shallow water dish. Whatever you do, but sure to keep the cage dry, [Okay.] or else mold and bacteria can grow that could make your dragon sick. [Okay.], and finally, you mentioned about lighting earlier. What do you need exactly to keep your beardie happy and healthy?\\n#Person5#: Having a full spectrum light and basking lamp are pretty key to raising healthy beardies. First, they need the simulated sunlight from the ultraviolet UV bulb ...\\n#Person1#: Now, is that the full spectrum light that you mentioned? Okay.\\n#Person2#: ... to absorb rays [Okay.], vital to the production of certain vitamins, [Okay.] and the high body temperatures of a basking light to aid in the digestive process.\\n#Person1#: Now, what kinds of temperatures are you referring to when you talk about the basking area?\\n#Person2#: Like ninety to a hundred degrees.\\n#Person1#: Okay, and I don't think they need sun tan lotion, right? [No]. Okay, uh, so, perhaps then, I could put my beardie in an aquarium and just set him by the window which gets direct sunlight? Would that work?\\n#Person2#: Well, actually, you can even take them outside two or three times a week in the direct sunlight; however, putting them in a glass aquarium with exposure to sunlight won't be viewed as a replacement for direct light or a UV bulb because the glass only filters out the sunlight they need.\\n#Person1#: Wow! I didn't know there was so much to know about raising a pet like that. Well, thanks very much for joining us today, Joshua.\\n#Person2#: My pleasure.### SUMMARY:\\n#Person1# welcomes Joshua to the Exotic Animal Kingdom show. Bearded dragons originated from the deserts of Australia, and this is one of several species that survived in that climate.

Look, I think I've got a plan of the place somewhere. Let me see.., yes, here we are. You can have this.\\n#Person1#: Thanks.\\n#Person2#: OK I'll show you. Let's start with the lower level. See? Here? You arrive by taxi or bus or whatever here, on the right, can you see? That's the bus terminal. And you go in through the main entrance. You could go to Water World first but I think you'd better miss that out as you're short of time, you said. You see the cable cars? Well, those long lines are the wires and the little circles are the cars going up and down to the next level. Well, walk past the cable car terminal, at the bottom of the plan, and bear right past the Waterfall Gardens. Actually, have a look in, there are ducks and other birds in the pool there-it's very pretty. Then you'll see some steps up on the left. Follow that path and you'll come to the Centenary Garden which is a good place to stop and take pictures if you've got your camera. Then carry on until you're almost at the Children's Zoo. Right. I wouldn't bother to visit the zoo if I were you, it takes quite a long time to walk round. But I do recommend the 'Touch and Feed' section opposite, as I said. It's great fun for small children.\\n#Person1#: Ok, so we'll pay a visit there, and then what?\\n#Person2#: You could come back a different way past the Chinese rock garden. Oh, that's lovely-do wander around if there's time. Then go down the steps to the Otter Pool-you can have a sit down there for a little while and watch the otters messing around in the water. Then back to the cable car terminal where you can catch a car to the upper level. The journey takes about ten minutes, I suppose, it's quite a long way. Now if you look at the other plan, the one for the upper level, you'll see where you arrive.\\n#Person1#: Is this the terminal here in the bottom left hand comer?\\n#Person2#: Yes, that's right. The fun fair is in the top left hand corner. Can you see? With 'The Dragon' I was telling you about, and 'The Octopus' and 'The Spider'. Do you think you'll want to go to that?\\n#Person1#: Um, well, I think the children are a bit too young really, but they might enjoy watching other people.\\n#Person2#: OK. Well, if you're feeling quite hungry by the time you arrive, which you probably will be, why not have a snack in the Chinese Restaurant next to the terminal? When you've finished your lunch, I would go to the Coral Reef first. It's that little building on the left hand side. 'That's where you can see fish and other underwater creatures in a kind of natural habitat.\\n#Person1#: Right. That sounds interesting.\\n#Person2#: It's lovely. After that, walk up to 'The Dragon' and watch people being really scared! Then you could come down to the Ocean Theater, which is just to the left of the center of the plan- and see a performance of dolphins or maybe the killer whale. You'll have to check the times for that. There's one at two o'clock, I think. I'm not sure about the high diving, but you may be able to see that as well. If there's time, you could also carry on to the fight and have a look at Wave Cove. And finally, if you're not too exhausted by then you could return to the lower level by using the famous escalator. You'd be finished by 3:30 or 4 at the latest.\\n#Person1#: Right, well, thanks for all your advice. Urn, we'll send you a postcard!\\n#Person2#: I'll look forward to it.### SUMMARY:\\nSince #Person1# just has four days in Hong Kong, #Person2# suggests #Person1# get to Ocean Park early. #Person2# also shows different levels of the park. #Person2# recommends the Waterfall Gardens, the Centenary Garden, the Children's Zoo, the 'Touch and Feed' section opposite at the bottom of the plan. #Person1# can come back a different way past the Chinese rock garden and visit the Otter Pool.

We have well established channels of distribution and we canvass the retailers direct, without any middlemen.\\n#Person2#: Do you keep a stock of these things?\\n#Person1#: In some cases, such as the wristwatches, which always have a steady market, we keep a stock in London and act as distributors as well as agents. Generally, however, we pass on the orders of our clients to the manufacturers for supply. We are paid for our service, of course.\\n#Person2#: That is, your commission.\\n#Person1#: Yes, our commission is very reasonable. We usually get a 10 % commission of the amount on every deal.\\n#Person2#: Our agents in other areas usually get a 3-5 % commission.\\n#Person1#: The European market is not familiar with your products. You have competitors from Japan and other continental countries.

We can not give you an exclusive agency of the whole European market without having the slightest idea of your possible annual marketing turnover.

Then about 3 months later we traveled to New York as we were waiting for our plane at the airport. I looked out of a huge window. At that very moment, I saw the largest truck in the world. I had to tell someone about this. I turned my father, who was standing next to about 1000 people waiting for various flights and screamed truck, truck. My father tried hard to shut me up, but I was so excited. I kept screaming my special word. My poor mother decided she didn't know this baby and ran into the ladies room where she hid until I finally stopped. Well, I learn how to say truck correctly and soon I was talking like a normal child.

I thought it was just, you know, having some problems, and it just kind of would go away.\\n#Person1#: Well, you know, I don't know about that with the bullying or whatever, but you know, this has been going on for a long time.

Some of the things he wrote are signs of, they might be thinking about suicide.\\n#Person2#: Ah, I, I, I just can't figure that out. I mean, kids sometimes just talk like that. I, I, I thought. I thought that was kind of natural.\\n#Person1#: Yes, sometimes they do that. That's what makes it hard. Sometimes, kids just talk like that, but some of them are serious, and some of them end up talking their own lives. Some of them really do kill themselves. You know, you need to take this seriously. Six months (of being depressed) isn't normal. Six months isn't just to act like this isn't just a phase. It's, there's something going on.\\n#Person2#: So, any ideas? I mean, what should I do?

[ Yeah ... ] You could take him down to the hospital, down to the emergency room, so ...\\n#Person2#: I don't know.\\n#Person1#: You know, it's really important because you've got to get on top of it.

I never heard the word 'queue' before. Um-what you call 'chips', I call 'French fries'. I never heard them called 'chips'. Urn-there's so many-urn-words that are different. Ah-' crisps' which mean ' potato chips' Yeah, that's - we call them 'potato chips' or 'chips' in America. You call them 'crisps' here. So when I heard the word 'chips', I was thinking of 'crisps' and not French fry-you know-it's very confusing but-urn-but just some of the expressions like-er-' mate' you know and 'love'.

Somet-maybe here and there, but not, not like you see it here. Ah-so many of the young people wear black-clothing-you know, I don't-you don't see the other colors. At home you see all different types of bright colors-and in England you see so much black. Especially on the women.\\n#Person1#: You don't like that?\\n#Person2#: Not really.

Oh, also, another difference is the young-er-the younger people are-they're more politically aware on a larger level. See a lot of the-a lot of the Americans- they're aware of-er-government of the United States and maybe a few other countries but not as many countries in Europe or they just have a vague understanding of how those other countries are run-not as widespread.

Over the years, they have become so rigid and complicated that they are now quite a head - ache for us importers.\\n#Person2#: In my opinion, overly strict regulations are just another way of restricting imports.\\n#Person1#: Ah, there's something in what you're saying.

I am done working for a company that is taking me nowhere! #Person2#: So what are you gonna do? Just quit? #Person1#: That's exactly what I am going to do! I have decided to create my own company! I am going to write up a business plan, get some investors and start working for myself! #Person2#: Have you ever written up a business plan before? #Person1#: Well, no, it can't be that hard! I mean, all you have to do is explain your business, how you are going to do things and that's it, right? #Person2#: You couldn't be more wrong! A well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less. Then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has, history, etc. #Person1#: Well, that seems easy enough. #Person2#: Wait, there is more! Then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services. What they are and how they are different from competitors? Then comes the hard part, a market analysis. You need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables! You need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from GDP per capita to how many children on average the population has! All this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage, where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea. #Person1#: Geez. Is that all? #Person2#: Almost, the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis. Here you will calculate and estimate sales, cash flow and profits. After all, people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment! #Person1#: Umm.
